MNIST Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy Only)
This repository contains a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) built entirely from scratch using only NumPy. No high-level deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) were used, focusing on the fundamental mathematics behind neural networks.

🧠 Project Overview
The goal is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the implementation of:

Forward Propagation (Linear → ReLU → Linear → Softmax)

Backpropagation (Chain rule implementation)

Gradient Descent (Parameter updates)

Image Pre-processing (Centering and scaling for custom inputs)

🛠️ Built With
NumPy: Used for all matrix operations and mathematical functions.

Pandas: Used for initial CSV data loading.

Matplotlib: Used for visualizing predictions and images.

PIL (Pillow): Used for processing external user-provided images.

🏗️ Model Architecture
Input Layer: 784 neurons (representing 28x28 grayscale pixels).

Hidden Layer: 10 neurons with ReLU activation.

Output Layer: 10 neurons with Softmax activation (probability distribution).

🚀 How to UseTraining the ModelRun the training script to perform gradient descent. The current configuration uses a learning rate ($\alpha$) of 0.25 and 500 iterations.
"W1, b1, W2, b2 = gradient_descent(X_train, Y_train, 0.25, 500)"

Predicting Custom Images
The script includes a smart_predict_image function that takes a custom image (e.g., sayi.png), inverts it, crops it, and shifts the center of mass to match the MNIST format for high accuracy.
smart_predict_image('your_digit.png', W1, b1, W2, b2)

📈 Accuracy
The model achieves significant accuracy on the training set within a few hundred iterations, proving that even a simple network with one hidden layer can solve the MNIST digit classification problem effectively.
